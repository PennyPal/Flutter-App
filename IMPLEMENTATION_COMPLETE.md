## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If OAuth Doesn't Work
1. Check deep link configuration (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. Verify OAuth credentials in Appwrite dashboard
3. Ensure redirect URIs match exactly

### If API Keys Don't Work
1. Double-check they're correctly entered
2. Verify they haven't expired
3. Check for typos or extra spaces

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
